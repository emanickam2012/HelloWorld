The application writes the output 'HelloWorld' to a console. 

The helloWorld application consists of the following:

1) HelloWorld API - An API for the client program to communicate with
2) HelloWorldClient - Client console which calls the API and outputs 'HelloWorld'
3) HelloWorldController1- A class library which contains all the modules that are used in the API
4) HelloWorldTests - Test project for the unit test in the project.


To run the solution:

1)Set the HelloWorldClient as the startup project
2)Rightclick or view the HelloWorldAPI in the browser window 
3)Run the application to view the output
